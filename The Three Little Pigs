Once upon a time, there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.The first and second pigs are lazy and refuse to work hard. The third pig is very hard working. As time goes by, the first and second pigs are married; however, the youngest pig is still single. Despite the terrible mood, he keeps working hard.
