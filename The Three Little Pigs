Once upon a time, there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.The first and second pigs are lazy and refuse to work hard. The third pig is very hard working. As time goes by, the first and second pigs are married; however, the youngest pig is still single. Despite the terrible mood, he keeps working hard. 
One day, the youngest pig was building a new pretty house for his future girlfriend. A wolf came over. The little pig was very scared and quickly hid in the house he had just built. The wolf said that don't be scared, I am not a wolf, but I am actually a fox. Little pig said you think I am a fool? Prove it to me! Wolf thought for a while, then he started to sing: "Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding! Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!"
(Reference from Ylvis - The Fox). The Little pig said: "okay I believe you now, come in please!"
The pigs little house was quite homely and nice. As the wolf disguised as a fox entered, he was astounded by the pristine decorating and the wonderful condition of everything. He quickly realized that this pig was a sentient being with feelings, hopes and dreams. "Oh little pig", he said, tearing up, I am so sorry, I was actually a wolf this whole time, but I don't want to eat you. However, as was revealed in the 1994 Disney Classic The Lion King, Everything belongs to the circle of life. The wolf quickly divided the little pig into its consitituent parts, turned the house into a smokeroom and returned home with heaps of bacon, sausage, ham and pork loins to feed to his young ones.
The end.
